algorithms - A bunch of CS algorithms for practice and fun
==============================================================

The algorithms are grouped by "chapters" or topics. Each folder corresponds to
a chapter, and each chapter includes several algorithms, one file per algorithm.

Yeah, I enjoy doing these type of algorithms and refresh my CS background every
now and then :)
